{% picture thumbnail-left 2008/black-widow.jpg alt="Black widow spider close-up" %}

My roommate has been noting the increased number of large and scary
black widows that have been hanging around my house lately. There was a
noticeable spider problem when I moved in, but I never really cared too
much. I've just been wiping the cobwebs down every few weeks. Maybe
they're enjoying the cooler weather as much as I am. For whatever
reason, they're out in force and once or twice have cause me to actually
feel a little fear. That's not something I need to stand for in my own
house, so I decided I'm going to fight back.

One thing is for sure, this wasn't going to be a job for some half-assed
can of raid, or whatever puny aresol can I could get at the grocery
store. I always wondered what those professional pest control guys
actually have in their secret tubes of death, so I went out looking.
After exactly [one google
search](http://www.google.com/search?q=black+widow+pesticide). I found
the good stuff. One pound of [Cynoff
WP](http://www.google.com/products?q=cynoff+wp) makes about 48 gallons
of sweet spidery slumber for only $48 shipped. You can't beat that with
a stick. It should arrive sometime next week.

**Update:** July 8, 2009 It's been almost a year and I must say this
stuff is the ticket. I've since discovered that you can actually get the
same chemical (cypermethrin) in the same wettable powder packaging for
about $30 per pound if you look for off brand labels. I've seen just a
handful of spiders since I sprayed and no black widows.
