  content: "When the Captains of Industry want to buy things they buy, like the labor
    to make the stuff they sell they go overseas. They don't buy it here. Everything
    is made in China. But they want us to buy stuff here NOW because they're hurting
    and business is bad. \r\n\r\nToo bad the Chamber wasn't into Buy Local back in
    the 90's when they were so into Outsourcing and Off-shoring. They dismantled all
    those factories against the wishes of the liberals and labor unions.     "

The [central valley buy local campaign](http://www.whyibuylocal.com/)
probably began with the best of intentions. The idea is simple, get
people to pump their hard earned cash right back into the place they
live and work. If everyone did this more, the local economy would be
much better off. It would be an easy way to stimulate the local economy
and we'd all be better off for the benefits in public services funding.

Before I launch into my tirade which I'm particularly jazzed about, let
me just start by saying that I actually like buying local and I even
like the buy local campaign. I would go so far as to say that the
campaign doesn't even come close to covering all the benefits the
economy would see if we were all following along.

I'm going to lead into my point with a story. My wife and I are
remodeling our master bathroom right now and today we needed to buy
shower valve trim. We'd already picked out the trim from the Delta
catalog lent to us by Fresno Distributing. This morning I show up before
work to order the trim and come to find out their price is roughly $205
per unit (we're using two), it's not in stock, it will take 7-10 days to
arrive, and I'll also have to pay the freight (but they don't know how
much) and of course tax. So I tell them I'm going to shop around and see
if I can't get a better price. As it turns out, I can order them from
faucet.com in New York, get them here tomorrow and pay only $182 per
unit plus I found a $20 off coupon and of course there's no sales tax.
So I ordered them from my couch this morning without regard to when
they're open because the internet doesn't care about things like store
hours. They should be here tomorrow which if you're paying attention is
700-1000% faster than Fresno Distributing.

Now, I'm perfectly willing to pay local sales tax and support the local
public services I use and enjoy, but only when the price and quality of
products and services I'm buying are comparable to the ones I can find
elsewhere. When there's a large discrepancy, there's no good reason for
me to buy local because last time I checked, local businesses were not
charity cases.

Last year I needed a blower motor for my car. So I called Napa auto
parts on Blackstone and asked how much the blower would set me back.
They told me $360 plus tax and I can pick it up in about a week. Not
being completely stupid, I went ahead and checked that price on the
internet and found the same one for $88.94 with free overnight shipping
and of course no sales tax. Would you like to double check me? Call a
local auto parts store and ask for this [blower motor
assembly](http://www.rmeuropean.com/Part-Number/Blower-Motor-Assembly-__8A1820021_FEB_D18BD03A.aspx).
I saved over 75% even before you consider the fact that I didn't have to
pay sales tax. I won't even get into the fact that I had to be on hold
for a few minutes with Napa and I had to tell two separate employees all
about my car so they could find the part.

That's just not acceptable for a local business. Even local businesses
are going to need to face up to the fact that we're living in a big
economy. Local businesses can run their operations however they want,
but in the end I'm going to make a rational decision about where I shop.
I want a good product at a fair price and excellent service. If you have
a local business and you're not giving me at least that, you probably
won't be seeing much of me. This is why I say buying local is not as
important as selling local.
