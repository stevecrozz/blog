on the initial buyout packages appears to be pretty slim and almost
certainly lower than the 13-25 number that I heard through the
grapevine. Barring some kind of miracle, there will have to be more
painful layoffs near the end of the month. This time no departments are
safe. I've been picking up pretty strong signals that even my own web
team is no longer invincible. In a meeting today, my suspicions were
reinforced. We're planning to lose at least one member of our six member
team.

Three of us are effectively exempt from the buyouts which leaves the
other three on the chopping block. So far everything has been handled
professionally, but it is painful to watch. This is the closest I've
ever been to this type of situation and I'm beginning to learn how real
it is. Even though I'm probably safe, it's still depressing to be in the
middle of it. More practically, I know that losing a teammate will lead
to lower productivity and probably lower product quality as well. I
can't say for sure that I would have declined a buyout opportunity had
it been offered.
