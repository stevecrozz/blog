I might make this a regular feature because I think pointing out some of
these bad job listings in a humorous way may help some businesses figure
out how to attract great web developers and designers. I'm hoping this
will be both funny and educational. This is an example from Fresno's
craigslist. I'm going to copy it here stripping out most of the
identifying information to protect the guilty.

There is so much wrong with this job posting I don't even know where to
start. First of all, it's really hard to find someone who has both solid
experience creating database-driven web sites **and** strong graphic
design ability. If you're target audience is Fresno, you may as well
just stop right there because I haven't met a single person in this town
who meets that criteria. Second, ten dollars per hour? You are out of
your mind if you think you can find a professional with solid experience
in any field for that amount, let alone a professional with solid
experience in a high-demand field like web development and design.  Have
you done any research at all into how much these types of people get
paid even here in Fresno? You need to almost triple that figure to
attract anyone worth your time and please don't ask that person to do
clerical work because you can hire someone else to do that.

Lets briefly mention software experience. If you can find me a single
professional web designer that doesn't have at least a decent
understanding of Photoshop and Illustrator, then I owe you some beer.
Also, do some more research because it's 2010 and nobody uses
Dreamweaver anymore. If they do, then you don't want to hire them. So
really your post should say, "must have no recent experience working
with Dreamweaver".

Are you sure you also want your ideal candidate to manage their own
projects? You should be aware that this addition makes you look
disengaged and lazy. Basically you're coming across as lazy, clueless,
out-of-date and irrational. If I were a potential candidate I would
expect these characteristics to enter our working relationship making me
frustrated and possibly rubbing off on my own character.

I know this comes off as insulting and it is that. On the other hand,
these job listings are insulting to me and other local professionals. I
hope my insults can be taken in a very general sense rather than a
mean-spirited and personal one. I don't mean to attack anyone in
particular, only to help anyone reading figure out why their job
postings aren't working and help them improve and hopefully do it in a
lighthearted way.

**Update Feb 15** You've gone and made it even worse by adding
e-commerce experience as yet another requirement. Have you had anyone
apply who's not still in high school?  This is still only $2.00 over
minimum wage. I can't even get a guy to come lay tile in my bathroom for
that price. Now you're just asking for it, I'm putting up a link to
[this shameful job
posting.](http://fresno.craigslist.org/web/1601957999.html).
