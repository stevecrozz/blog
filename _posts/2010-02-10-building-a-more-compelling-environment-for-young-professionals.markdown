I have two good options for internet service at my home in the Fresno High
area: AT&T DSL which tops out at 1.5Mbits at my location or comcast which is
much faster but can't be unbundled from cable TV service which I don't want and
costs almost $80 / month. This is not attractive to a young professional like
myself and doesn't score the city any points when trying to attract other young
professionals to the area.

This is why I was excited to see [Google's announcement
today](http://www.google.com/appserve/fiberrfi/public/options) about offering
its own internet service to interested municipalities. What's more, they want
residents and city officials to nominate their own communities to be among the
first on Google's rollout list. If we can get enough interest going, perhaps we
can be one of the first cities on Google's new internet service area plus it
would get us some national attention and in a good way. Can we do it?

The service Google will be offering is 1Gb on an all-fiber network which is
many hundreds of times more than my current service with AT&T. Lets force AT&T
and Comcast into a real competition for once. I'm tired of crappy internet
service and sometimes it makes me wish I lived elsewhere.
