<p>I would have had a better time if you could buy a cup of beer for less than $11, but it was still an amazing show. Watching Wilco and The Smashing Pumpkins rock out on accoustic instruments only was an experience to say the least.<&#47;p></p>

<p>Most of the people were there to see Jack Johnson and Norah Jones, but Wilco got a nod of approval from Norah Jones with this cover. I thought it was classy:<&#47;p></p>

<p>In case you decide to go next year, you should know that you can pretty much bring anything to the show as long as its not glass , aluminum or alcoholic. Half the people there were smoking marijuna, and we brought in big sandwiches from a shop in Berkely.<&#47;p></p>
