"Gate of opportunity" class: "img-float-left" %} In this age where
information is power, it's hard to understand why we're all wringing our
hands at the current state of the economy. Here at newspaper firms, we
have libraries full of valuable information at our disposal. Most of it
just sits on the shelf undisturbed for ages.  Some forward-thinking news
outlets saw the opportunity to digitize their information in the hopes
of transforming the old library into a serious revenue machine.

While the vast majority of newsrooms were sitting on their thumbs,
google has been busy [amassing](http://google.com)
[more](http://research.google.com/)
[information](http://www.youtube.com) than you could possibly
[imagine](http://finance.google.com), and now they've even started
archiving [newspapers](http://news.google.com) available to view
[exactly as
printed](http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=758KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jk0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5233,4059827&dq=clark+gable+army).

Google is planning for the future! Google is moving into position where
it can be the keeper of as much information as possible. Where does that
leave the current "keepers" of that information? When the prophesies are
fulfilled and information is crowned king, I'll still be here to say I
told you so. Why don't I hear screams of anguish from all the newspaper
execs who've missed the boat? Now is the time to grab hold of every bit
of information you possibly can and hold onto it like a starving monkey
eying the last banana on earth.
