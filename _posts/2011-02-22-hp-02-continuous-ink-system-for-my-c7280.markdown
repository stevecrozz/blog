    think this would be suitable for a small office needing to print 1000 color reports
    per month?

  content: "I'll try to remember to come back and update this post after some time
    goes by so you can see how well this setup holds up. After all this, you may be
    surprised to learn that I rarely print anything. The CIS pictured above cost me
    about the same as a regular set of cartridges would have, plus they have auto-resetting
    chips built in.\r\n\r\nI probably won't be able to tell you how well this system
    would do under heavier printing conditions, but as cheap as it is, I'd probably
    still recommend it assuming you can stomach the risk of damaging your printer
    and voiding the warranty."

    Since I installed this CIS, I've probably printed about a hundred print jobs (a
    few hundred pages). Sometimes the first page comes out a little wonky, but after
    it gets going the pages look pretty nice. Nothing is clogged or ruined as far
    as I can tell. I love the CIS. I bore everyone who comes to visit by talking about
    this system.

<p>Having been thoroughly satisfied with prior HP printer experiences, I made the mistake of purchasing a brand new HP Photosmart c7280. I'm a big fan of these all-in-one devices. I especially like having a WiFi interface, and scanning to a USB disk as opposed to some ridiculous TWAIN protocol is such a great idea it's hard to imagine why some devices still don't support it. But all the things I love about this printer are outweighed by the horrible ink system.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Lets start with the most obvious problem with these ink cartridges. They're way too small, the color cartridges are only 11 mL. I've seen claims that they can yield up to 500 pages. I have no data to argue with that figure, but I can tell you it seems very high compared to what I've seen. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-323"></a><a href="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0338.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0338-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="hp photosmart c7280 loaded with crappy hp ink" width="290" height="217" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-332" &#47;><&#47;a> There's also five separate colors and one black, but that's not a huge problem until you combine it with the thing I hate most about this ink system. If you run out of any color, or if a color simply "expires", you cannot print at all, even in monochrome. Even all this wouldn't bother me except for what I think it means. It's obvious to me that HP designed this ink system primarily to sell print cartridges (at an enormous profit). All the arguments about protecting the user from ruining the printer by running expired or low print cartridges is nonsense. Everything about this system is specifically designed to extract as much money as possible from users buying ink.<&#47;p></p>
<p>In fact, this ink system is so bad, I was actually planning to throw this whole machine away and get something else. That's when I discovered continuous ink systems (CIS). The idea being to continuously feed these puny ink wells with a fresh supply from larger containers. Unfortunately, HP has equipped its print system with both a timer and a page counter. That means as soon as you print the last page in the counter or as soon as the last second ticks from the timer, the whole machine grinds to a halt and will not excrete another drop of ink until you go buy more. Fortunately, there's a whole industry now built around chip resetters and auto-resetting chips with which this system claims to be equipped.<&#47;p><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0334.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0334-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="hp 02 ciss covered in ink" width="590" height="442" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-330" &#47;><&#47;a><a href="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0337.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0337-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="hp 02 ciss sitting out to dry" width="590" height="442" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-331" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>So I picked one up on eBay and it arrived today. As you can see, the magenta leaked quite a bit during shipment, so I had to wash it off for a while in the kitchen sink.<&#47;p><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0340.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0340-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="installing the new ciss for the hp 7280" width="590" height="442" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-333" &#47;><&#47;a><a href="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0341.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0341-590x442.jpg" alt="" title="the new cartridges are installed" width="590" height="442" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-340" &#47;><&#47;a><a href="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;resized.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;resized-1024x682.jpg" alt="" title="why do they even bother with this message?" width="590" height="392" class="alignright size-large wp-image-334" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>The new cartridges fit perfectly in the printer although it seemed impossible to get the latches down. I think this particular CIS was designed with another model in mind. I managed to get it installed by very carefully pulling the delivery tube out of each cartridge, clasping them in place and reinserting the tubes.<&#47;p><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0351.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0351-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="fresh printing with the new cartridges" width="590" height="442" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-335" &#47;><&#47;a><a href="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0353.jpg"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;lithostech.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;02&#47;100_0353-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="the new cis reservoirs installed on the side" width="590" height="442" class="alignleft size-large wp-image-336" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Next time the HP complains about low or expired ink, I can simply power off the machine for 30 seconds and the counters on the new cartridges should reset themselves. The next time I buy ink, I hope its something like <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Compatible-Refill-Cartridge-3210v-C5140&#47;dp&#47;B001KT0JCO">this<&#47;a>.<&#47;p><br />
