    think this would be suitable for a small office needing to print 1000 color reports
    per month?

  content: "I'll try to remember to come back and update this post after some time
    goes by so you can see how well this setup holds up. After all this, you may be
    surprised to learn that I rarely print anything. The CIS pictured above cost me
    about the same as a regular set of cartridges would have, plus they have auto-resetting
    chips built in.\r\n\r\nI probably won't be able to tell you how well this system
    would do under heavier printing conditions, but as cheap as it is, I'd probably
    still recommend it assuming you can stomach the risk of damaging your printer
    and voiding the warranty."

    Since I installed this CIS, I've probably printed about a hundred print jobs (a
    few hundred pages). Sometimes the first page comes out a little wonky, but after
    it gets going the pages look pretty nice. Nothing is clogged or ruined as far
    as I can tell. I love the CIS. I bore everyone who comes to visit by talking about
    this system.

    works very well. It looks like your system has the same bulk ink tank as mine.
    Can you please tell me the name of the eBay vendor you bought it from, or any
    branding information?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

%} Having been thoroughly satisfied with prior HP printer experiences, I
made the mistake of purchasing a brand new HP Photosmart c7280. I'm a
big fan of these all-in-one devices. I especially like having a WiFi
interface, and scanning to a USB disk as opposed to some ridiculous
TWAIN protocol is such a great idea it's hard to imagine why some
devices still don't support it. But all the things I love about this
printer are outweighed by the horrible ink system.

Lets start with the most obvious problem with these ink cartridges.
They're way too small, the color cartridges are only 11 mL. I've seen
claims that they can yield up to 500 pages. I have no data to argue with
that figure, but I can tell you it seems very high compared to what I've
seen.

  %} There's also five separate colors and one black, but that's not a
huge problem until you combine it with the thing I hate most about this
ink system.  If you run out of any color, or if a color simply
"expires", you cannot print at all, even in monochrome. Even all this
wouldn't bother me except for what I think it means. It's obvious to me
that HP designed this ink system primarily to sell print cartridges (at
an enormous profit). All the arguments about protecting the user from
ruining the printer by running expired or low print cartridges is
nonsense.  Everything about this system is specifically designed to
extract as much money as possible from users buying ink.

In fact, this ink system is so bad, I was actually planning to throw
this whole machine away and get something else. That's when I discovered
continuous ink systems (CIS). The idea being to continuously feed these
puny ink wells with a fresh supply from larger containers.
Unfortunately, HP has equipped its print system with both a timer and a
page counter. That means as soon as you print the last page in the
counter or as soon as the last second ticks from the timer, the whole
machine grinds to a halt and will not excrete another drop of ink until
you go buy more. Fortunately, there's a whole industry now built around
chip resetters and auto-resetting chips with which this system claims to
be equipped.

So I picked one up on eBay and it arrived today. As you can see, the
magenta leaked quite a bit during shipment, so I had to wash it off for
a while in the kitchen sink.

{% responsive_image path: static/img/full/2011/ciss/resized.jpg alt: "why do they even bother with this message?" class: "img-full" %}

The new cartridges fit perfectly in the printer although it seemed
impossible to get the latches down. I think this particular CIS was
designed with another model in mind. I managed to get it installed by
very carefully pulling the delivery tube out of each cartridge, clasping
them in place and reinserting the tubes.

Next time the HP complains about low or expired ink, I can simply power
off the machine for 30 seconds and the counters on the new cartridges
should reset themselves. The next time I buy ink, I hope its something
like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Compatible-Refill-Cartridge-3210v-C5140/dp/B001KT0JCO).
