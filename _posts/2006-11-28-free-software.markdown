Why would anyone shell out big dollars for the latest and greatest
software suite when free software works just as well? Sometimes we like
to have the support, sometimes there’s a cutting edge-feature that we
have to have, maybe we’re used to a certain software company’s
interface.

For the rest of us who don’t like to pay annual cash tributes to
software companies, there’s countless free and open source software
suites out there for anyone who wants to brave wild west of the free
software world.

Here’s a list of free software packages that I have tested and meet my
approval:

Instant Messaging
 : [Miranda-IM](http://www.miranda-im.org/) Since the world of instant
 messanging is so diverse and so many platforms exist, I use Miranda. It
 connects to any service you could possibly want to connect to using
 various plugins. Mine is connected to AIM, MSN, Yahoo, and Google-Talk.
 It’s lightweight and simple, and there are great skins to make it look
 good on your desktop.

Media Player
 : Currently I use [winamp](http://www.winamp.com/). While winamp 5 is
 very beautiful, it is much slower than some of its predecessors. There
 are still many places where you can download the classic winamp 2.95.
 This is without a doubt the best winamp ever. It works, it’s free, and
 it’s fast. Whenever you use it, or any other digital audio player
 especially internet radio, thank Dmitry Boldyrev for his ideas,
 inspiration and brilliant coding.

Compression Utility
 : [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) is bar none the best compression
 utility I have ever used. I never even open the program. I use the
 software entirely inside context menus with a simple right click. It
 opens every compressed file format I’ve ever run into including gzip
 and tarballs.

P2P
 : If you do any file sharing, do yourself a huge favor and grab the
 latest copy of [eMule](http://www.emule-project.net/).

Image Manipulation
 : Use the [gimp](http://www.gimp.org/), its powerful, and easy. If you
 don’t need something this powerful, check out Google’s Picassa. And
 while you’re at it get imageMagick. Imagine being able to resize,
 frame, optimize, and thumbnail a set of images with a single click.
 This is possible through scripting with imageMagick and its many APIs.

Office Suite
 : What’s that? You don’t want to pay $400 to be able to type in
 Microsoft Word? I don’t blame you. Download
 [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/), a whole office suite that is
 very competitive with MS office, except it doesn’t cost a dime.  You’re
 worried about compatibility? Well don’t be. OpenOffice is compatible
 with more document formats than MS Office.

AntiVirus
 : As a home PC user, please don’t pay a single red cent for your
 antiVirus software. I would rather watch someone smoke a cigar wrapped
 in $100 bill. Download either [Avast](http://www.avast.com/) or
 [ClamWin](http://www.clamwin.com/). They’re great, they’re simple,
 they’re free, they don’t bug you, and they don’t use up all the
 resources on your computer like some others do.

Web Browser
 : I’m surprised I still have to even recommend this, but
 [FireFox](http://www.getfirefox.net/) is at least making an attempt to
 adopt the DOM standards that were approved over 10 years ago. Another
 browser which shall remain nameless thinks it gets to decide how the
 internet runs. If you don’t understand all this, just trust the geeks
 and ditch internet explorer in favor of firefox.

Codec Pack
 : Ever try to play a movie on your computer and find out you don’t have
 the right codec for it? Are you constantly prompted to download real
 media plyer or apple quicktime or some other garbage media player?
 [K-Lite codec pack](http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm) is
 answer number one. Then get [quicktime
 alternative](http://www.codecguide.com/download_qt.htm), you shouldn’t
 have that trouble again.

PDF Reader
 : I’ll be honest, Adobe Acrobat Reader bugs me. It takes a long time to
 open, its huge, and it always asks to update itself. Use
 [FoxIt](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php) instead, they’re
 up to version 2 now and it looks even cleaner and faster than the last
 one. Why would anyone use Acrobat? They either haven’t heard of FoxIt,
 or they enjoy wasting time.

Task Manager
 : If you have trouble deleting a file because it’s ‘in use’ but you
 know it’s not, then you need [Process Explorer
 32](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/ProcessExplorer.mspx).
 It really should be the default windows task manager, and you can
 actually set it that way.

Testing Server
 : [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html), if you need a
 testing server, and you have to use windows, then this is what you
 need, it has everything you could need including apache, mysql, perl,
 php, fileZIlla server, and many more server programs.

Operating System
 : Everyone has their favorite free operating system. Unfortunately for
 me, there’s a lot of reasons why I have to run windows. When I finish
 with school there will hopefully be a lot less of those. For anyone who
 doesn’t absolutely need windows I recommend Ubuntu. With XGL it looks
 absolutely stunning. In fact I would say it looks prettier than Apple
 OSX. Anyway its worth a look.

PBX Server
 : If you need an open source PBX server you probably already have this,
 I’m just going to include it here for completeness.
 [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/).

FTP
 : FileZilla

SSH
 : [PuTTy](http://www.putty.nl/download.html): This is pretty much the
 industry standard windows SSH-2 client.

SCP
 : WinSCP
