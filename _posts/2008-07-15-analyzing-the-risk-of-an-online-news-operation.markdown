It's no secret that newspaper classified ad revenues have fallen
dramatically since craigslist became a major player in that market.
David Boardman, executive editor for the Seattle Times wrote a
[column](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004423461_boardman18.html)
claiming that in 2000 classifieds made up as much as 50% of total ad
revenue for the company. This year, that number has fallen to 20%. In
the same period, craigslist revenue grew from practically nothing in
2000 to an estimated $80-100 million for 2008. I'm not going to try to
prove causality, but bear with me while I try to explain what I think is
obvious.

While newspapers were busy squeezing every last penny out of internet
page views and paid classified advertising, [Craig
Newmark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Newmark) was unknowingly
creating a classified empire. Craig's system is far better for *people*
because it is free (for the most part) and doesn't assault the eyes with
mind-numbing banner ads. The layout is clean and adheres strictly to
KISS principles.

At this point in the conversation, newspaper buffs seem to take a
defensive position. Usually they make some outrageous claim like "How
can we compete with craigslist? We're running a for-profit company
here!" First of all, it's true that craigslist started with a flavor of
altruism and was likely <i>losing</i> money at first; but that's not the
case anymore. That argument might have worked in 1999, but its no longer
relevant because craigslist does make money and lots of it! Plus, the
popularity of craigslist continues to grow while the popularity of
newspaper classifieds continues to fall. This is what that argument
really says: "We were too shortsighted to see that our classified ad
revenue figures were artificially inflated because our system was
ultra-vulnerable to competition that didn't yet exist. We put up far
more risk than we could stomach and now its too late to take it back."
Fair enough, not everyone can be a visionary entrepreneur like Newmark.

I don't see this as a fluke, but as a foreshadowing. Don't think this
can't happen elsewhere in the industry. Seattle residents found
craigslist to be *better* than the Times' system. They were willing to
go elsewhere for the same service. Does anyone see where this line of
reasoning is going? Many newspapers still treat their online readers
just like they used to treat their online classified readers and posters
back when those readers still existed.

The same forces that pushed classified revenues away from newspapers are
still at work today and those forces are able to take from newspapers in
new and profound ways. This is the power of competition. The best
players have the best chances of winning the game, and everything is at
stake now. Imagine what would happen if a great writer and photographer
started writing local news on her blog. Then this hypothetical blog is
endowed with all the features that newspaper web sites have been wanting
to implement for years. This blog will become a real threat to the very
heart of the newspaper (the news).

Newspapers need to come to a more full realization of how much of their
bread and butter is riding on the line and how risky their current
business practices are. They need to step down their risk even if it
means taking losses for the sake of building sustainable online
presences.
