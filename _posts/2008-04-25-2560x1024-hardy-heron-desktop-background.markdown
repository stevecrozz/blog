{% responsive_image path: static/img/full/2008/double-heron.png alt:
"Hardy Heron desktop background for two monitors" class:
"img-float-left" %} I couldn't resist making a nice big desktop
wallpaper for my dual monitor setup out of the cool new hardy heron
ubuntu artwork. I found the [vector graphic
file](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Hardy?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=hardy_wallpaper.svg)
to work with, and simply widened it up and moved the heron further to
the right using Inkscape. I exported the bitmap and touched it up a bit
in the GIMP, and I'm posting it here to save others the 15 minutes I
took to do it.
