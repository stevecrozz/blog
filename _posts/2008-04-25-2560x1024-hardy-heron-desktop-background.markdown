excerpt: "I couldn't resist making a nice big desktop wallpaper for my dual monitor
  setup out of the cool new hardy heron ubuntu artwork. I found the <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Incoming/Hardy?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=hardy_wallpaper.svg\">vector
  graphic file</a> to work with, and simply widened it up and moved the heron further
  to the right using Inkscape. I exported the bitmap and touched it up a bit in the
  GIMP, and I'm posting it here to save others the 15 minutes I took to do it. \r\n\r\n"
