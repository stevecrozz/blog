"oss-phone-lineup" class: "img-float-left" %} A new development in the
mobile operating system market brings an open source convert to the
table. As of [Symbian's
announcement](http://blog.symbian.org/2010/02/04/symbian-is-open/)
today, three of the five major players can now be considered open source
systems. This pits Microsoft and Apple's closed systems directly against
Google, Palm and Symbian in an epic battle of ideology. The playing
field for desktop operating systems has always been slanted because open
source systems haven't had competitive desktop systems until recently
(after most folks have already grown well accustomed to their closed
source systems).

In the mobile arena, there isn't much in the way of legacy software to
support so there's no advantage given to systems that support legacy
software. Since hardware manufacturer's ensure their hardware support is
excellent and aren't required to support much in the way of third-party
hardware there's no advantage given to systems that have widely
available device drivers. This has for many reasons been a typical
sticky point for open source systems and hardware manufacturers who
don't want to spend time writing device drivers for a tiny fraction of
their users. End-user's don't generally need to spend a lot of time
accessing support services because mobile systems are generally very
simple and don't require the same level of support as desktop systems.
So there's very little advantage given to systems that come with
excellent support.

Advantages are given to systems that don't require a user to start from
a blank slate and reenter all their contacts, but there's no clear
winner here. Advantages are also given to systems that make integrating
with other systems easy. The clear winner here is open source. The only
real advantage I see for close source systems is the small head start
they have on their open source counterparts. It's going to be
interesting to see how this all plays out in an arena which forces Apple
and Microsoft to play a different kind of ball game where they're not
given an enormous advantage over open source. May the best systems
win.
