excerpt: So I decided to head out to lunch with a buddy from work today, and while
  I was out the world went insane. Both parties in the house of representatives worked
  together to defeat the $700B bailout plan, the Dow Jones had its largest single-day
  point drop in history, and our publisher (a 41 year bee veteran), Ray Steele resigned.
  A new guy, Will Fleet, will be taking the reigns in two weeks. Needless to say,
  I was a little shocked when I came back.
