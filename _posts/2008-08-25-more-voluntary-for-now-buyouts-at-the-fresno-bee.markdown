door to the old Fresno Bee building" class: "img-float-left" %} The
Fresno Bee continues to do everything it can to stave off more
inevitable layoffs. I don't blame them, but I sure am getting tired of
the bad news:

> We are offering voluntary buyout packages under a Voluntary Separation
> Program to employees as another step to reduce expenses as we change
> our business practices to adapt to the economic challenges and
> transition to an integrated multi-media company.

I'm not going to post a lot of commentary on this, but if we are
"changing our business practices", then I might have to build some kind
of high-precision tool to measure the imperceptible change.
