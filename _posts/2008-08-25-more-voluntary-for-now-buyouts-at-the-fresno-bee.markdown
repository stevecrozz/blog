  layoffs. I don't blame them, but I sure am getting tired of the bad news:\r\n\r\n<cite>We
  are offering voluntary buyout packages under a Voluntary Separation Program to employees
  as another step to reduce expenses as we change our business practices to adapt
  to the economic challenges and transition to an integrated multi-media company.</cite>\r\n\r\n"
