At about this time semi-annually, I can no longer hold myself back from
upgrading to the next version of Ubuntu; and usually I am quite sorry I
did just because of the nature of alpha software. The transition from
edgy to feisty, feisty to gutsy, and from gutsy to hardy was a little
painful at the alpha stage because the new network-manager applet was in
its early stages. Each of those upgrades caused problems with my
internet activity which made it difficult to access the internet and
hence report bugs.

This time around my wireless internet connections are stable and we're
still only in alpha 4, plus the automated bug reporting system is much
better tuned. We're starting to see a much more mature product emerge
after all this time. Looking at the [upcoming
features](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/intrepid/alpha4), you'll see
things like "encrypted private directories", "3g support", and a new
"guest account".

At first I was a little disappointed to see these features because
unlike [previous versions](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/hardy/alpha6),
they seemed small in comparison. But now I feel that Ubuntu has climbed
to a kind of development plateau where all the bare necessities of a
truly excellent operating system are in place and working well. I'm
truly proud to be a member of the Ubuntu community and I welcome the
upcoming "small" features as a sign of our community's excellence.
