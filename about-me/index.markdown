  content: "Hey,\r\nLove your writing. Found you through some OpenWRT stuff, which
    I dont understand much. I noticed in one of your recent posts that you switched
    to WordPress from Drupal. I also noticed that you said you were using a stock
    theme. If you need any support making some design changes, Id be more than happy
    to help.\r\nI was wondering if you could direct me in some place to start learning
    about \"software engineering\". I use that term lightly, but Im a designer looking
    to invest some time to becoming proficient at coding with a purpose. Ive spent
    most of my recent time learning to modify WordPress themes. As a result, I've
    learned some basic PHP, but nothing too heavy. \r\nIm wondering how you got to
    where you are and what you can suggest to an aspiring student."

  content: 'The best way to get started is to find an open source project you like,
    maybe Wordpress for you, and participate. Subscribe to the development mailing
    lists and hang out in the IRC channels. Most OSS projects are happy to have help,
    especially writing documentation and triaging bugs. My advice boils down to this,
    and this is what I myself try to do: find some people who are smarter than you
    and hang out with them. Just listen to their conversations for a while and before
    you know it, you''ll be right there with them.'

<p>Thanks for taking the time to get to know me. My name is Stephen Crosby and I love to write web applications. These days, I spend most of my time working hard at RightScale, working the kinks out of tough cloud management problems. They call me a software engineer, but I really just like to tinker with code all day. RightScale provides me with a great environment to play with all kinds of new technology in the ever-present world of cloud computing.<&#47;p></p>
<p>I am a huge fan of free software and an Ubuntu evangelist. If you haven't tried Ubuntu, you really should. Go download the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ubuntu.com&#47;download&#47;ubuntu&#47;download">live CD<&#47;a> and you can give it a shot before you even install it. I've contributed in very small ways to a few free software projects like the Zend Framework, Drupal, Wordpress, OpenWRT and uWSGI but I would like to do more in the future.<&#47;p></p>
