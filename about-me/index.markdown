Thanks for taking the time to get to know me. My name is Stephen Crosby and I
build web applications.

Today, I'm building the next generation of document storage and contract
management solutions at [SecureDocs](https://www.securedocs.com) in Goleta, CA.
We have a small engineering team, but I'm continually impressed by the quality
of the software we produce.

At [RightScale](https://www.rightscale.com), now
[Flexera](https://www.flexera.com), I built and maintained both frontend and
backend systems for our customers who trusted us with their cloud
infrastructure. RightScale provided me with an incredible environment to learn
and build while writing software that scales.

In 2014, I co-founded [Branded Crate](http://www.brandedcrate.com/), a
small application development and marketing company here in Santa
Barbara.

I am a huge fan of free software. I’ve created or contributed to many
open source software projects. Check out my github page to see what I’m
up to: [https://github.com/stevecrozz](https://github.com/stevecrozz)
