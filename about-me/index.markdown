Thanks for taking the time to get to know me. My name is Stephen Crosby
and I love to write web applications. These days, I spend most of my
time working hard at RightScale, working the kinks out of tough cloud
management problems.  They call me a software engineer, but I really
just like to tinker with code all day. RightScale provides me with a
great environment to play with all kinds of new technology in the
ever-present world of cloud computing.

I am a huge fan of free software and an Ubuntu evangelist. If you
haven't tried Ubuntu, you really should. Go download the [live
CD](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download) and you can give it
a shot before you even install it. I've contributed in very small ways
to a few free software projects like the Zend Framework, Drupal,
Wordpress, OpenWRT and uWSGI but I would like to do more in the
future.

If you're curious to see what I've been up to, check out my github page:
