Thanks for taking the time to get to know me. My name is Stephen Crosby
and I build web applications. At
[RightScale](http://www.rightscale.com), I build and maintain both
frontend and backend systems for our users who trust us with their cloud
infrastructure. RightScale provides me with a great environment to play
with all kinds of new technology in the ever-present world of cloud.

In 2014, I co-founded [Branded Crate](http://www.brandedcrate.com/), a
small application development and marketing company here in Santa
Barbara.

I am a huge fan of free software. I’ve created or contributed to many
open source software projects. Check out my github page to see what I’m
up to: [https://github.com/stevecrozz](https://github.com/stevecrozz)
